# I. INTRODUCTION:

In recent years, carbon dioxide ($CO_2$), a molecule born from the combustion of fossil fuels, has become a silent yet potent threat to human life and the environment. As the primary greenhouse gas, $CO_2$ emissions play a crucial role in climate change, casting a long shadow of devastating consequences across the globe. Rising sea levels threaten coastal communities, the temperature reaches the highest in hundreds of years, wildfires rage across parched landscapes, and droughts cast long shadows across fertile lands. These are not isolated incidents, but rather the consequences of the rising carbon dioxide emissions caused by the demand for energy. In this article, we will navigate a sea of data, charting the course of emissions across diverse nations and continents, and uncovering the intricate connections between human activity and the shifting balance of our planet.

# II. DATASETS:

For this article, we used three datasets:

-   CO₂ Emissions Dataset (Source: [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-dataset-sources "CO₂ emissions dataset: Our sources and methods"))

-   Climate-related Disaster Frequency (Source: [International Monetary Fund](https://climatedata.imf.org/datasets/b13b69ee0dde43a99c811f592af4e821/explore "Climate-related Disasters Frequency"))

-   NFBA 2023 Public Data (Source: [Global Footprint Network](https://www.footprintnetwork.org/licenses/public-data-package-free/ "National Footprint and Biocapacity Accounts 2023 Public Data Package"))

```{r}
# Source: Our World in Data
co2 <- readr::read_csv('~/Mscs 164 F23/Project/Fay & Luanga Project Folder/Fay_Luanga/owid-co2-data.csv')

# Codebook; Source: Our World in Data
codebook <-  readr::read_csv('~/Mscs 164 F23/Project/Fay & Luanga Project Folder/Fay_Luanga/owid-co2-codebook.csv')

# Climate Disaster Frequency Dataset
Climate_related_Disasters_Frequency <- read_csv("~/Mscs 164 F23/Project/Fay & Luanga Project Folder/Fay_Luanga/Climate-related_Disasters_Frequency.csv")
# Ecological Footprint Dataset

NFBA_2023_Public_Data_Package_1_0 <- read_excel("//home/rstudio/courses/2023-24-semester1-mscs-164/Project/Fay & Luanga Project Folder/Fay_Luanga/NFBA 2023 Public Data Package 1.0.xlsx", 
    sheet = "Country Results (2019)", range = "A23:AF206")

eco_footprint <- NFBA_2023_Public_Data_Package_1_0

```

For the first dataset, since it includes both data from nations and continents, we decided to split it into to a sub-dataset (**continent_co2** and **county_co2**) using filter(). We also used join() functions and parse_number to tidy the Climate Disasters dataset.

```{r}
# Here, we are trying to create a separate, cleaner dataset which includes just continents (and not states!!!). We are also filtering the data to be after 1970.

continent_co2 <- co2 |>
  filter(year >= 1970, country %in% c("Africa","Asia", "Europe", "South America", "North America", "Oceania")) |>
  select(-gdp)
```

```{r}
# Here, we are trying to create a separate, cleaner dataset which includes just states (and not continents!!!). We are also filtering the data to be after 1970.
country_co2 <- co2 |>
  filter(year >= 1970, !(country %in% c("Africa","Asia", "Europe", "South America", "North America", "Oceania")), 
         !is.na(iso_code))
```

```{r}
# Pivoting longer to make it suitable for viewing
disasters_long <- Climate_related_Disasters_Frequency |> 
  filter(Indicator == "Climate related disasters frequency, Number of Disasters: TOTAL") |>
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("F"), 
    names_to = "year", 
    values_to = "disasters") |>
  mutate_at("year", str_replace, "F", "") |>
  replace_na(list(disasters = 0)) |>
  mutate(iso_code = ISO3, year = parse_number(year)) |>
  select(year, iso_code, disasters) 
```

We also utilized the ***countrycode*** package to get the ISO Code and the official names of nations and continents.

```{r}
# Converting country ISO Codes to a country name, or to designate a region for it. This is where the country code library help us out!

disasters_long$continent <- countrycode(sourcevar = disasters_long$iso_code,
                             origin = "iso3c",

                             origin = "iso3c",

                             destination = "un.region.name")

eco_footprint$continent <- countrycode(sourcevar = eco_footprint$Country,
                             origin = "country.name",
                             destination = "un.region.name")
```

```{r}
disasters_long <- disasters_long |>
  mutate(country = fct_recode(country, "United States" = "United States of America (the)", "Philippines" = "Philippines (the)", "Vietnam" = "Viet Nam"))
```

```{r}

  mutate(eco_decifit = `Ecological (Deficit) or Reserve`)
```

According to the plot above, we can conclude that the countries that contribute most to the $CO_2$ emissions of the world are the industry-heavy countries, leading by the United States and China

### 3. Which countries have the best and worst ecological footprints?

Ecological footprints are a measure that takes into account an individual or country's usage of nature and biocapacity.[^1]

[^1]: <https://www.footprintnetwork.org/our-work/ecological-footprint/>

That means that if my neighborhood is constantly churning out pollutants into the air and cutting up our green spaces to put in new buildings, I will have a high eco-footprint. If my neighbourhood is churning out pollutants into the air but keeping the green spaces, my ecological footprint will be bad but not horrible. If my neighbourhood uses clean energy, maintains (and even adds!) to its green spaces, it has a great ecological footprint, and might even have an ecological *reserve* instead of a deficit.

We can scale up this concept to countries! So we decided to take a look at the Top 10 worst ecological footprints and the Top 10 best ecological footprints. We filtered the data so that it used a *per-capita* measure. This is a targeted universalist approach as it means that it takes into account population sizes of countries.

We can also zoom out and look at climate heroes and zeros on a continental scale!
