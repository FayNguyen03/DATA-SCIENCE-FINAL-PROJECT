1. The names of my project team are:

Khanh Tra Nguyen Tran

Luanga Kasanga


2. If you are working alone offer a short note about WHY you feel it is the best way for you to show your knowledge. If you are working with more than 2 people, please verify that you have spoken to Prof BV about your plan. Note that your requirements on the rubric will be to have 4-5 graphs and 1000-1800 words.  If you are working in a team of 2, skip this question.

N/A

3. Verify that each member of your group has read the "Teamwork" section of the [rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10hyyeQ1JgDvgLZIJ0RLDXcipGFJ4wYf7Ai6TiJToqc4/edit?usp=sharing).

We have reviewed the Teamwork expectations and verified our commitment.


4. Provide a link to your potential data source:

https://github.com/owid/co2-data

From Our World in Data

5. Provide a brief description of your project ideas. A couple sentences is fine. Think about what questions you are interested in, or what variables you will consider. 

Overall, we will observe Climate CHange impacts across countries since CO2 (carbon dioxide) emissions is a big concept of climate change. We want to observe how different states have perfomed relating to the Paris 2016 climate accords over the years, both before the agreement was signed and after. We wanted to also observe how their dependence on different energy sources (and its affect on their GDP) relates to their CO2 emissions


These are some variables that we consider to use: 

`energy_per_gdp`:	Primary energy consumption per unit of gross domestic product, measured in kilowatt-hours per international-$.

`temperature_change_from_co2`:	Change in global mean surface temperature (in Â°C) caused by $CO_2$ emissions. This measures each country's contribution to global mean surface temperature (GMST) rise from its cumulative emissions of carbon dioxide. The warming effects of each gas are calculated based on cumulative CO2-equivalent emissions using the Global Warming Potential (GWP*) approach.

`trade_co2`:	Annual net carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) emissions embedded in trade, measured in million tonnes.


Knit and submit ONE per group.
